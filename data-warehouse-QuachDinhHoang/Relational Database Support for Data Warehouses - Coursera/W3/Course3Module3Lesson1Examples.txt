-- Example 1: rank products by unit price
SELECT ItemId, ItemBrand, ItemUnitPrice,
  RANK() OVER ( ORDER BY ItemUnitPrice ) AS RankUnitPrice

-- Example 2: rank customers by descending sum of sales

  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(SalesDollar) DESC) AS SumSalesRank
  FROM SSSales, SSCustomer
  WHERE SSSales.CUSTID = SSCustomer.CUSTID

-- Example 3
-- Additional problem: statement not shown in the notes
-- Rank brands by average sales in 2010 and 2011

-- Example 4
-- Additional problem: statement not shown in the notes
-- Rank brands by average sales in 2010 and 2011
-- Only include brands with more than 10 sales in 2010 and 2011
